I am a final-year master student at Software Institute, Nanjing University, studying natural language processing, supervised by Dr. Tieke He. Specially, my research focus on text generation, such as dialogue system and question generation. Before at Nanjing University, I received my Bachelor's degree from Southwest Jiaotong University. Outside of NLP I like power lifting and watching basketball games.
